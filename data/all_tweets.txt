NightmareWedding
Max you better hurry up before this fool kills your wife
NightmareWedding
The mom walks away from seeing Sandy kissing Roman
NightmareWedding
Lmao this movie is ridiculous
NightmareWedding
Roman knocked Max out Shouldve been more epic
NightmareWedding
Cant expect a guy named Roman to be any sort of mentally stable right
NightmareWedding
And to think this is how they decided to end  our Saturday nights until after the holidays
NightmareWedding

NightmareWedding
Sandy is the part of being a ivanka trump as Donald trumps oldest daughter they look alike
NightmareWedding
They got married with 30 minutes to go in the movie  Hes about to find her body
NightmareWedding
If a grown man wants to pinkie swear hes a psychopath lol
NightmareWedding

NightmareWedding
Megans just there for the open bar Max hair is even annoying me
NightmareWedding
Lmao this movie is ridiculous Max even run annoying
NightmareWedding
That is literally 2 hours of our lives we cant get back
NightmareWedding
I dont think Sandy and Max are a good match and are not mature enough to get married  So that bump on Maxs head made him lose his accent  Cuz now he sound regular
NightmareWedding

NightmareWedding
Had to run to the storesooo is he gone kill the bff

NightmareWedding
Oh come on Sandy dont fall for that its just Roman messing with your head
NightmareWedding
Did they find out that Lisa was dead during that abrupt commercial break
NightmareWedding
Roman is playing everyone like a fiddle
NightmareWedding
Roman is a smooth operator winking at Sandys mom
NightmareWedding
I kind of liked
NightmareWedding
Alright lets wrap this weak movie up
NightmareWedding
I love how Max has been so oblivious to Romans intentions almost the whole movie but then wakes up amp realizes everything
NightmareWedding
How you spike a teaspoon of a drink  There wasnt enough alcohol to even dissolve two pillssheeit one
NightmareWedding
Psychopaths are charming to get what they want
NightmareWedding
I must saylast good  movie had to be Death of a Vegas Showgirl

NightmareWedding
Wake up daughter Youre a drunk whore PS Lisa is dead they found her at the bottom of the ravine
NightmareWedding
Shes going to see Lisas body
NightmareWedding
So Roman is just going to scoot on over amp flirt with mom
NightmareWedding
This movie feels like its been on for a week   At this point IDC if he kills her when her kidnaps her Im so over her and this movie rn
NightmareWedding
Hmmshouldnt they be a little more worried about Lisa Like stop by her house or something
NightmareWedding
Girl what are you doing
NightmareWedding
Kinda thought Lark would be more mad but she was understanding
NightmareWedding
Well ROMAN is not expecting to get away with any of this RIGHT I want him to get the electric chair like once hes caught
NightmareWedding
Uh oh he found her backpack
NightmareWedding
So he was supposed 2 go to the bridal shower  His friend supposed 2 b hot
NightmareWedding

NightmareWedding
Bad acting aside I actually enjoyed it
NightmareWedding
That purse hasnt left her side all night Roman needs to just leave
NightmareWedding

Kovalev
Watch replay much closer than saw live still  should have won or at worst draw
Kovalev
got a knockdown and that was the difference I gave the win 114113 to   will have to give a rematch
Kovalev
Super clean knockdown in Round 2 2017
Kovalev
Amazing fight but a 114114 or 115113 for  would have been a justified score
Kovalev
Fighting from the clinch counts The closer they are the better its been for  Round 6 to him  up 3
Kovalev
Prefight I wanted a  win But  was clearly robbed last night and has a right to be disgusted at that decision Fuck America
Kovalev
Watch Andre  vs Sergey  highlights

I just watched Round 12 twice and Im still not sure who won  hit HARDER  BOXED BETTER I gave it to KOVALEV  wins

Thru 4  is landing the betterbigger shots Ive got him up by 5 points due to the knockdown in Round 2

Larrry Merchant called it 116111 Kovalev winningEven Wards corner told him he needed a knockoutembarrassing

Kovalev
got robbed Smh
Kovalev
stole Round 11  taking too many body shots Its showing going into the 12th Whoever wins Round 12 wins my card
Kovalev
Close great fight but I think  edged it
Kovalev
Watching again  and  won an even number of rounds the rounds Kov won were more emphatic plus knockdown he wins by 1 for me
Kovalev
Catching up with the  fight as couldnt stay awake  Looks like  was aheadthats boxing for ya
Kovalev
I gave  Round 10 Hes up 1 over
Kovalev
BAD JUDGING Sergey Krusher  knocked down Andre  in 2nd rd won 1st 6 rds lost on cards 114113 3x
Kovalev
I feel like  had the fight but chased Ward instead of cutting off the ring Looked like he was trying to coast That cost him IMO

Ward and   Deliver Drama Controversy and an Instant ClassicESPN had  winning easily over  with a knockdown the rd is 108 So at 114113 that means Ward won 7 rds to 5 No way

I tell you what Im watching these post fight interviews and Im CERTAIN for better or worse  is going to go for a KO in Fight 2
Kovalev
Thought  won last night Close fight but think he edged it
Kovalev
Knowing how this ends already Im gon assume this trend continues  must keep dominating from the clinch  up 2 thru 7
Kovalev
Round 3 was close Gave it to  but if you gave that round to  thats ok I wouldnt object
Kovalev
It appears that most are saying  won itlooks like another bad scoring
Kovalev

metvstartrek
Extra bad special effects in 45 minutes

Last 6 rounds all close but  didnt do enough and  defo did more and edged themthats what won the fight IMO
kovalev
and  whats up with judging in Vegas
kovalev
definitely was robbedI am starting to hate the sport I love
kovalev
Boxing once again painted in a bad light How Ward got that decision I have no idea Kova won the first 6 10th12th Sad day
kovalev
Had  winning that one by 2 rounds  There should definately be a rematch
kovalev
is the reason why fight fans are switching to  and

absolutely shocking decision Not even close  was robbed

Just woke up because of staying up for the fight last night  So worth it  Glad I did stayed up

lived up to hype Best pound for pound match of 2016 Great technical fighttight decision Thought  had itAfter rewatching the fight   won rounds 457891112
kovalev
how to survive after so many missed punches to the body
kovalev
114 to 113 makes perfect sense
kovalev
Ok I Agee a slight exaggeration that was one of the worst descions  but it was very clear  won ea
kovalev
Ward seemed to get his timing second half of the fight I thought  won more early rounds
kovalev
Fancied  prefight had  winning by 1 round Would hate to see a rematch want Ward to return to SuperMiddle

Twotime Olympic champion  wins her pro debut on  undercard
KovalevWard
Still Sergey Kovalev 100 got robbed Press conference comingthis is a bit much because of rudeness
KovalevWard
I had that fight a draw But honestly couldnt have seen it going Wards way As much as I was routing for him
KovalevWard
Just catching up on  and if it wasnt a draw it was a  victory
KovalevWard
All Judges from USA  absolute disgusting
KovalevWard
judges on that Roc Nation payroll
KovalevWard
Just watched  great fight hard to score but I think Ward just bagged it
KovalevWard
also whilst Im ranting the  decision was a joke
KovalevWard
Boxing go home you are drunk
KovalevWard
Thoroughly enjoyed  up until Kovalev let the Electoral College decide the winner of the match
KovalevWard
Just caught up with   I had ward winning by 5 he controlled nearly every round after the knockdown Counterd ver well
KovalevWard
They finish strong Rd 12 to Ward I have Kovalev winning 115112 Very good fight
KovalevWard
Mo Speights    DeQuan HamptonJudges scorecard
KovalevWard
On 18 rounds on the scorecards across the second half of the fight can anyone honestly justify Kovalev winning just one
KovalevWard
After 12 I have  winning 75 the knockdown in  favour brings it to Ward winning by a round in my eyes
KovalevWard
USA  Hold my Beer
KovalevWard
Time to catch up on last nights boxing then
KovalevWard
Close fight but  showed his class and deserved the win in my opinion Repeat fight surely
KovalevWard
My scorecard 116111 for Kovalev On to judges
KovalevWard
I had it 115112 Kov and thats after chucking Ward a close one to even things up
KovalevWard
SERGEY KOVALEV POST FIGHT ANDRE WARD IS NOT CHAMPION TALKS ABOUT IMMEDIATE REMATCH
KovalevWard
Kovalev just got outclassed by  Cant beat experience On to the rematch
KovalevWard
Judges score the fight 114113 for Andre Ward Wow Disagree
KovalevWard
Strong round for  as we close out the 9th You dont want to miss this finish
KovalevWard
https
KovalevWard
In  and  you must have a neutral refere
KovalevWard
The system is rigged
KovalevWard
the fight Close rounds but I think the right man won Rematch Id love to see it You want to see best going at it   22
KovalevWard
Nice chat
KovalevWard
Avoided spoilers  and then cherry pick  fightsHad  winning that one by 2 rounds  There should definately be a rematch
KovalevWard
Close fight but had Kov winning by 2 Ref should have been stronger dealing with the Ward holding
KovalevWard
Total robbery or total incompetence Neither is acceptable
KovalevWard
Im amazed by the amount of people here on Twitter that were going crazy about a robbery
KovalevWard
Looks like a fun day
KovalevWard
Huge congratulations to  on getting the win with his second half performance

TOUCHDOWN CLEMSON
CLEMvsWAKE
Clemson is rolling Go Tigers
CLEMvsWAKE
Theres the game Gallman walks in the 1 yard TD 3513
CLEMvsWAKE
Why are we going right to left now  1st Q we went left to right
CLEMvsWAKE
Dabo needs to light a  on that sideline
CLEMvsWAKE
As a kid I witnessed the longest punt in NFL history 98 yards by Jets Steve ONeal
CLEMvsWAKE
Hey Clemson fans Get ready for your heart attack
CLEMvsWAKE
Wake still playing the field position game Really lulling Clemson to sleep with their long game
CLEMvsWAKE
Gooooo Tigers
CLEMvsWAKE
Are you feeling the heart attack    Unanswered 13 points Just 2 interceptions away
CLEMvsWAKE
Fourth quarter  Finish strong Tigers
CLEMvsWAKE
Clemsons offense needs to get back into this game Deacs really dominating the punting battle tonight
CLEMvsWAKE
Cloudy with a 100 chance of Wayne
CLEMvsWAKE
starts now
CLEMvsWAKE
Halftime lead but we need to stay after it in the 2nd half
CLEMvsWAKE
In a loss thought Cade Carney ran hard and Chucky Wade was strong as well
CLEMvsWAKE
Clemson has zero killer instincts Every week they let teams hang around
CLEMvsWAKE
Got the win Now on to the next one
CLEMvsWAKE
We enter the 4th quarter with Clemson leading 2813 over Wake Forest
CLEMvsWAKE
The stacked screen is the reincarnation of Rob Spencers bubble screen It was better off dead
CLEMvsWAKE
Good things happen when u have a run game    Brrrr Gave up after halftime
CLEMvsWAKE
Hunter Renfrow woulda fielded those punts take Ray Ray out Gooooo Tigers
CLEMvsWAKE
Wot u guys doing tonight I has pizza amp switching between  amp   And I think Im going to do some crochet
CLEMvsWAKE
ballpark  split of fans at game tonight
CLEMvsWAKE
Great game Clemson Tigers ACC Champ game here we come
CLEMvsWAKE
My seat for
CLEMvsWAKE
Brrrr Gave up after halftime
CLEMvsWAKE
So cool when the hubs school plays mine
CLEMvsWAKE
Come on right now Where is the killer instinct Come on Wake you gotta score in the red zone Chance to make it 2817 now 2813 after settling for a FG
CLEMvsWAKE
80yard punt
CLEMvsWAKE
Its a 23yard field goal to cut the Tigers lead to just 15 points with 530 left to play in the 3rd
CLEMvsWAKE
Love the sprint out punt into the wind Wake knew it was coming as they were pointing it out
CLEMvsWAKE
Worst thing being  player being 64 and playing  in the country on  empty stands
CLEMvsWAKE
So did  get their hands on the  game plan I guess that would explain this lead
CLEMvsWAKE
After the two qb runs you still have to tackle Gallman You dont and he hits his head on the goalpost
CLEMvsWAKE
33 passing att for 202 yds amp 36 rushing att for 220 yds looks like a lot better play distribution than last week
CLEMvsWAKE
Helps to have the wind at your back but that 80yard punt by Wake Forests Dom Maggio was impressive
CLEMvsWAKE
Open field tackling has to improve
CLEMvsWAKE
RayRay stone hands McCloud Geez Louise
CLEMvsWAKE
Clemson needs a new defensive coach
CLEMvsWAKE
Everything now is about finishing  Finish strong
CLEMvsWAKE
Did Dabo just use wife leaving you as an overcoming adversity reference Amazing
CLEMvsWAKE
Thats nothing
CLEMvsWAKE
Lets go Tigers This is how u bounce back after a stinging loss
CLEMvsWAKE
Yesss This game just became a little more easy to watch
CLEMvsWAKE
Why cant  capitalize on success Great 1st QTR followed by we got this uninspired football letting WF back in it
CLEMvsWAKE
Love that effort by Leggett Thats a spark this O needs
CLEMvsWAKE
TIGERS Fight Tigers Fight    Took care of business on the road now on to
CLEMvsWAKE
We need to figure our short yard plays Not sure why we are in the shotgun to get one yard Why start 5 yards back
CLEMvsWAKE
I swear it feels like Tommy Bowden is back at Clemson Enough of this put Wake away
CLEMvsWAKE
Why did the clock keep running to end the 3rd QTR when Watson ran out of bounds  Thought that stopped the clock
CLEMvsWAKE
An 80 yards punt by the Wake Forest punter I guess he got all of that one
CLEMvsWAKE
I love it   You suck  The spread is 235
CLEMvsWAKE
Someone put the wind on scholarship
CLEMvsWAKE
How about that effort from Jordan Leggett
CLEMvsWAKE
The big play to Wade was a play action deep shot Good check down to Wade ends up being an explosive play Wade is a player
CLEMvsWAKE
Need a statement drive here Touchdown Figure out how to put teams away
CLEMvsWAKE
Clemson with a big drive there The run game came in 87th Ran it well tonight
CLEMvsWAKE
Are there vuvuzelas at this game or something What the hell is that sound
CLEMvsWAKE
run game is a joke
CLEMvsWAKE
Clemson wins the ACC Atlantic division tonight with a 3513 win at Wake Forest Tigers improve to 101 overall 71 in the ACC
CLEMvsWAKE
Doing what they do all year  Second half look like crap  Cant finish at all  Dont look like a champion team like
CLEMvsWAKE
Good things happen when u have a run game
CLEMvsWAKE
Touchdown Gallman  leads  3513
CLEMvsWAKE
Deacs really taking advantage of the wind this quarter
CLEMvsWAKE
starts nowGreat My heart rate is up again Please Clemson stop Wake then score a few more TDs and NO MORE TURNOVERS
CLEMvsWAKE
SMH
CLEMvsWAKE
Clemson plays 1 good qtr and rest looks like dumpster fire
CLEMvsWAKE
Finally Watson running the ball a little  What was everyone saying about the run game
CLEMvsWAKE
I wish Clemson would run back a kick off for a TD  Hasnt happened this season
CLEMvsWAKE
How about that effort from Jordan Leggett Thats the definition of BYOG
CLEMvsWAKE
Stop   home side at Wake mostly empty but tons of  orange still here to start second half 2810 Tiger l
CLEMvsWAKE
All these negative Nelly Tiger fans need to go away Have you ever heard of the power of positive thinking
CLEMvsWAKE
Come on right now Where is the killer instinct
CLEMvsWAKE
4th qtr Wind  your back Finish them Go Tigers
CLEMvsWAKE
Anyone else got that feeling
CLEMvsWAKE
Watching  at  after wrapping up an amazing season with  earlier
CLEMvsWAKE
Clemson wins ACC
CLEMvsWAKE
Took care of business on the road now on to
CLEMvsWAKE
Anyone know when the the tigers will get back to death valley
CLEMvsWAKE
I guess  thought scoring 28 points in the first quarter was enough
CLEMvsWAKE
Somebody tell me they have the 3rd string in Dabo needs to light a  on that sideline
CLEMvsWAKE
Booked Hotel in Orlando

CLEMvsWAKE
Touchdown Wayne Train We are rolling baby 3510    How about that effort from Jordan Leggett Thats the definition of BYOG
CLEMvsWAKE

Awaiting Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney post game presser after clinching berth in ACC Championship game
CLEMvsWAKE
Theres no z in Clemson knock that shit off
CLEMvsWAKE
Clemson with a big drive there The run game came in 87th Ran it well tonight Absolutely so easy to forget
CLEMvsWAKE
Former  brothers connect my man  from  out here taking in some ball
CLEMvsWAKE
Touchdown Wayne Train We are rolling baby 3510
CLEMvsWAKE
Good finish to the half for Wake Forest They get the ball and the wind to start the half Critical drive for them
CLEMvsWAKE
Tickets to ACC Championship Game
CLEMvsWAKE
Former  brothers connect my man  from  out here taking in some ball   Hey Clemson fans Get ready for your heart attack
CLEMvsWAKE
You suck  The spread is 235
CLEMvsWAKE
Wake gives up some yards but gets off the field Stop was set up by a negative yardage play on 1st down
CLEMvsWAKE
Come on Wake you gotta score in the red zone Chance to make it 2817
